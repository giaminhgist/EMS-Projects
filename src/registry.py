"""Locked experiment registry for the current (2026-09-23) run matrix.

Single source of truth for: the 10 locked seeds, the 5 proposal configs
(RE-NUMBERED per user decision 2026-09-23) and the 10 baselines with their
subject-level representations.

ID mapping (re-numbering, recorded to avoid mixing methods across numbering):
  EXP-PROP-001 <- old EXP-PROP-006  mlp_deepset  (MAIN proposal)
  EXP-PROP-002 <- old EXP-PROP-005  mlp_mean
  EXP-PROP-003 <- old EXP-PROP-001  mlp_attn
  EXP-PROP-004 <- old EXP-PROP-007  z_mean (hard z-deviation)
  EXP-PROP-005 <- NEW               mlp_max (masked max pooling only)
Removed from the active suite: old 002 (lambda_norm — removed from code and
docs), old 003/004 (sub/zsub comparators), old 008/009 (diff/mahal hard
deviations; still implemented in the model but not run).

lambda_norm is REMOVED from the code and documentation (user decision
2026-09-23): the model has no HC-concentration regularization anymore.

Protocol: official subject-level 4-fold validation (Set_0..Set_3). Same folds
and same seeds for every experiment. Checkpoint policy (development
comparison): best outer-validation AUC epoch, earliest epoch wins ties; the
ACC/SEN/SPEC/F1 reported are taken at that same checkpoint.
